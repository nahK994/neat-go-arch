### 🚀 How to Run It (Like a Pro)

#### 🧰 Prerequisites

Make sure you've got these tools installed first:

- 🐳 **Docker** — for spinning up Postgres like a boss  
- ⚙️ **Make** — to run tasks with a single command  
- 🍸 **Go + Gin** — the fast HTTP web framework (not the drink… or is it?)

---

#### 💥 Quickstart

Once you've got the tools, you're just two commands away from glory:

```bash
# 1️⃣ Start Postgres via Docker
make docker-up

# 2️⃣ Run the app
make run
```

Need to wipe and restart fresh?

```bash
make docker-down  # Stop and remove containers
make reset-db     # (Optional) Reset your DB + migrate again
```

---

#### 🧪 Bonus: Test it Out

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/signup \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"Shomi", "email":"me@code.com", "password":"secret"}'
```

Boom 💥 — user created (if all’s well). You’re now running a Clean Architecture app with swagger.
